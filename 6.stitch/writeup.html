<h2>
[Auto]Stitching Photo Mosaics<br>
<b>Due Date: It's complicated (see below).</b>
</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
This project is all about stitching together many photographs to create larger composite images.
It is divided into several parts <b>with different due dates</b> (see
'Deliverables'):
</p>
<ol>
<li>
In the first part, you will capture source photographs, define correspondences between
them, and then warp and composite them. A detailed description of the requirements and
scoring is given <a href="http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/2014_fall/hw/proj6-stitch/partA.html">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
In the second part, you will automate the correspondence-finding portion of Part 1
so that you can create the panoramas automatically. A detailed description of the
requirements and scoring for this part are given <a href="http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/2014_fall/hw/proj6-stitch/partB.html">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
In the third part (<b><u>graduate class only</u></b>), you will use the homography mapping from
Part 1 to create a 3D model from a single photograph.  See description
<a href="http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/2014_fall/hw/proj6-stitch/proj6g">here</a>.
</li></ol>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<p>
Since this is an odd multi-part project, there are several due dates:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b style="color:red">Wednesday, Nov 13</b>: code and project report for
the <a href="http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/2014_fall/hw/proj6-stitch/partA.html">first part</a> should be complete.
If you need to turn this in late, email course staff so we can grab a copy.
</li>
<li>
<b style="color:red">Friday, Nov 22</b>: code and results from the <a href="http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/2014_fall/hw/proj6-stitch/partB.html">second
part</a> are due, along with any bells and whistles.
<b>Note:</b> This final report should cover the results from both parts of the project (don't just replace your first report).
</li>
<li>
<b style="color:red">Friday, Nov 22</b>: Additionally, <b>for the graduate
class</b> (or as extra point for undergrads), code and results from the <a href="http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/2014_fall/hw/proj6-stitch/proj6g/">third
part</a> are due, along with any bells and whistles.  But we suggest that you started
early on this one, since you only need Part 1 to work to start on this.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
For turn-in, use the <tt>proj6/www</tt> and <tt>proj6/code</tt> folders, as per the <a href="http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/2014_fall/hw/submitting.html">submission instructions</a>.
